Machine Translation - Unsegmented Languages. Translation of any Unsegmented Language to a Segmented or Unsegmented Language according to the user.

Presenting an effective approach to translating unsegmented languages like Chinese and Japanese into a segmented language like English.
We achieve this by using a model called statistical machine translation systems. 
This model learns how to translate by analysing existing human translations (known as bilingual text corpora).
Furthermore, it generates statistical models that transform text from one language to another with that statistical weights are used to decide the most likely translation.
It expects to decide the correspondence between a word from the source language and a word from the objective language. A genuine illustration of this is Google Translate.
There are several types of statistical-based machine translation models including: Language Model (LM), Translation Model (TM) and decoder. 
The decoder will make use of LM and TM to generate the translation.
Along with this, the translation of one language to another is done using 3 methods in Statistical-based Machine Translation (SMT): 
Hierarchical phrase-based translation, Syntax-based translation, Phrase-based translation, Word-based translation.
